===== Building rekonq from source =====


=== Prerequisites ===

rekonq needs at least KDE SC 4.5.x and Qt 4.7.x to build.

Qt:

  Qt should be prepackaged for all major Linux distributions. Please see
  http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt for more information and installation
  instructions.

KDE SC:

  KDE SC should be prepackaged for all major Linux distributions. Please see
  http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/stable_Version
  for instructions on how to build and setup a KDE4 environment to work in.


=== Building rekonq ===

To build it perform the following commands after switching into the rekonq directory
(for example ~/mainline or ~/0.4):

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make && make install

If you want to install rekonq locally, do not run the "make install" command. rekonq can
then be found in build/src and is executed with ./rekonq.

=== Getting Help ===

If you need help with rekonq, you can find it in the IRC channel #rekonq on irc.freenode.net or by viewing the handbook that comes with rekonq.
You can view the rekonq handbook by pressing F1 after starting rekonq.
