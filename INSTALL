===== Building rekonq from source =====


=== Prerequisites ===

To build, rekonq needs at least:

- Qt 4.7.x:
- QtWebkit 2.2.x
- kdelibs 4.7.x

This software should be prepackaged for all major Linux distributions.
Please see http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started#Building_and_Running_KDE_Software_From_Source
for instructions on how to build and setup a KDE4 environment to work in.


=== Building rekonq ===

To build it perform the following commands after switching into the rekonq directory
(for example ~/mainline or ~/0.4):

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make && sudo make install

If you want to install rekonq locally, do not run the "make install" command. rekonq can
then be found in build/src and is executed with ./rekonq.

=== Getting Help ===

If you need help with rekonq, you can find it in the IRC channel #rekonq on irc.freenode.net 
or by viewing the handbook that comes with rekonq.
You can also view the rekonq handbook by pressing F1 after starting rekonq.
