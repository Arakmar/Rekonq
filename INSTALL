===== Building rekonq from sources =====


=== Prerequisites ===

Rekonq needs at least KDE SC 4.5.x and qt 4.7.x to build.

Qt:

  Qt should be prepackaged for all mayor linux distributions. Please see
  http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt for more information and installation
  instructions.

KDE SC:

  KDE should be prepackaged for all mayor linux distributions. Please see
  http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/stable_Version
  for instructions on how to build and setup a KDE4 environment to work in.


=== Building rekonq ===

To build it perform the following commands after switching into the rekonq
(for example ~/mainline or ~/0.4):

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make && make install

To install rekonq locally, do not run the "make install" command, rekonq can
then be found in build/src and is executed with ./rekonq.

If you need help with rekonq, you can find it in the irc-channel #rekonq on irc.freenode.net or by viewing the Handbook that comes with rekonq.
